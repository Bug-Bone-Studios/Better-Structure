# 🌟 ** Better Structure Project Template ** 🌟

Welcome to my **Better Structure**! This is the initial attempt at setting up a **solid code structure** that I will refine and expand over time. The goal is to create a project that is both flexible and scalable, ready to implement new features and templates as the development process continues.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**:

This project aims to establish a clean foundation that can be built upon with more advanced functionality. Initially, I am focusing on:

- **Setting up basic structures**
- **Ensuring flexibility for future features**
- **Creating a solid code base for scalability**

## 🔧 **Code Structure**:

I’ll be using the **best-known practices** for structuring Godot projects, focusing on modularity and clarity. The structure will evolve as new features and templates are added, and I’m open to refining it as I go. Here's a brief rundown:

- **Scenes**: Organized based on their role and type (player, enemies, UI, etc.)
- **Scripts**: Split into reusable classes and functional scripts.
- **Assets**: Grouped by type (textures, sounds, animations, etc.)

> **Tip:** As this project grows, the code will be continuously refactored to ensure it’s clean, maintainable, and easy to understand.

## 🔄 **Development Process**:

### 1. **Starting Simple**:
I’ll begin with a basic version of the project, focusing on core mechanics. Once I have a working foundation, I can start adding more features and refining the game loop.

### 2. **Feature Expansion**:
I plan to gradually add features that can be templated and reused across the project. These will include things like:

- Customizable **player mechanics**
- **AI behaviors**
- Reusable **UI elements**

### 3. **Iterative Improvement**:
I believe in **iterative development**, so as new concepts emerge, I’ll revisit and update earlier stages of the project to improve code quality and performance.

## 🎯 **Goals**:

- **Make the code modular**: So it’s easy to add, remove, or adjust features.
- **Focus on scalability**: Plan for future updates without overcomplicating early work.
- **Enhance readability**: Clear and concise code with proper comments.
- **Reusability**: Build templated features that can be quickly modified and integrated into the game.

## 💬 **Next Steps**:

- **Add core gameplay mechanics** (e.g., movement, collision detection)
- **Set up templates for reusable assets** (like character models and animations)
- **Refactor code as new features are added**

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack**:

- **Godot Engine**: Latest stable version
- **GDScript**: Primary scripting language
- **Version Control**: Git (with GitHub repository for easy collaboration)

## 📝 **To Do**:

- [ ] Create initial character controls
- [ ] Set up environment/scene structure
- [ ] Add placeholder UI elements
- [ ] Test basic player interactions
